_Topic:_ **Exploration and analysis of publicly available data: Suspension of parking bays in Dublin City Council.**

_Summary:_ The project showcases a complete data science workflow — including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and the application of machine learning models. Particular attention is given to managing real-world data quality issues, especially human input errors in categorical variables. Both regression and classification models are explored, with notable success in predicting suspension costs using supervised learning techniques, despite the dataset’s noisy nature. Overall, the work highlights practical approaches to working with imperfect public sector data.
